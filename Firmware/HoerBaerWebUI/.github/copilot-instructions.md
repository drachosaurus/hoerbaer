# HoerBaer Web UI Copilot Instructions

This is a remote control app to control the HoerBaer over a web interface.

It is very important that this web app compiles to a self contained, minimized bundle. No server side javascript code execution possible (this is a web interface of an embedded system).

Please avoid creating all these readme files and instructions for every change. I'm the only developer - no team instructions needed.
