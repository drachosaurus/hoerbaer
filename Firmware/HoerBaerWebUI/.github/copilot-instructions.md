# HoerBaer Web UI Copilot Instructions

This is a remote control app for a music player for kids (the "HörBär"). The player itself is shaped like a baer. 
Every paw is a button that contains a playlist. When a Paw is pressed, the first song of the playlist is played. When the playlist is already playing, the next song of the playlist is played. The remote control app shall have: - a classic player control screen, showing the name of the current playing song, play/pause, next, previous. - A screen that shows a list of all the songs stored on the different paws (plays song when clicked on it). The UI shall be mobile first (but will be a web app at the end).

It is very important that this web app compiles to a self contained, minimized bundle. No server side javascript code execution possible (this is a web interface of an embedded system).

Please avoid creating all these readme files and instructions for every change. I'm the only developer - no team instructions needed.
